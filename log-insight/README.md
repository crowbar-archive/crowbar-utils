# log-insight

Copy this to your admin node (/home/crowbar/log-insight.pl, for example)

    chmod 755 /home/crowbar/log-insight.pl

and just run it

    ./log-insight.pl

it produces output you can see at:

http://192.168.124.10:3000/log-insight.html

That is all.

More features, especially grabbing the errors of currently failed nodes, to come.
